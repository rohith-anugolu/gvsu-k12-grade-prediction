# K–12 Student Grade Prediction

This project predicts student grade outcomes using demographic and academic features. It applies both Multinomial Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify performance into multiple grade levels.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

- Predict academic grades (A, B, C, D, Other) for K–12 students
- Explore the impact of demographic and academic factors
- Support early intervention strategies through classification insights

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- R, tidymodels
- Multinomial Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Feature engineering
- Cross-validation (vfold)
- ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

---

## 📊 Key Results

- Top predictors: parental education, income level, absenteeism
- Models achieved ~48% accuracy with ~0.60 ROC-AUC
- LDA slightly improved sensitivity for lower-grade classes
- Recommended targeted support for students in public schools and low-income households
